Description: An open-source implementation of latent variable methods and multivariate modeling tools. The focus is on exploratory analyses using dimensionality reduction methods including low dimensional embedding, classical multivariate statistical tools, and tools for enhanced interpretation of machine learning methods (i.e. intelligible models to provide important information for end-users).   Target domains include extension to dedicated applications e.g. for manufacturing process modeling, spectroscopic analyses, and data mining.
